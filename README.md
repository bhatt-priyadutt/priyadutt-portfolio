## [**Project: Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster**](https://github.com/bhatt-priyadutt/Titanic-Machine-learning-from-disaster)

* This project was implemented to predict whether the passengers in the titanic crash survived or not. 
* The prediction was done using features like passenger class, fare, age, embarked.
* I have used hyper parameter tunning to increase the accuracy of the model and implemented on Flask framework in which user would enter the details about the passenger and based on the input, the model predicts whether the passenger survived or not.
* Models used: Logistic Regression, GaussianNB, KNeighborsClassifier.
* Accuracy achieved using logistic regression:82%.
