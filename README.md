## [**Project: Titanic-Machine Learning from Disaster**](https://github.com/bhatt-priyadutt/Titanic-Machine-learning-from-disaster)

* This project was implemented to predict whether the passengers in the titanic crash survived or not. 
* The prediction was done using features like passenger class, fare, age, embarked.
* I have used hyper parameter tunning to increase the accuracy of the model and implemented on Flask framework in which user would enter the details about the passenger and based on the input, the model predicts whether the passenger survived or not.
* Models used: Logistic Regression, GaussianNB, KNeighborsClassifier.
* Accuracy achieved using logistic regression:82%.

## [**Project: House Price Prediction**](https://github.com/bhatt-priyadutt/house-price-prediction)

* This project was implemented to predict the prices of the house. 
* Prices were predicted by taking some useful features into account like location, size of house (total square feet), No. of rooms, price per square feet etc. 
* During the project, the preprocessing steps that have been performed are:1.) Dealing with missing data. 2.) Encoding categorical variables 3.) Feature Engineering 4.) Finding Correlation within independent variables using heatmap.
* Libraries used: Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* Models used: Linear Regression, Ridge.
* R2 Score achieved using RidgeCV: 99%  
* Mean Absoute error :14.7


## [**Project: Stock Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/bhatt-priyadutt/stock-sentiment-analysis)

* This project was implemented to predict whether the companyâ€™s stock price increases or decreases. 
* Based on the headlines of various sources about a company, I performed sentiment analysis to predict the price increase or decrease.
* Models Used: RandomForestClassifier.
* Methods Used: Count Vectorizer.
